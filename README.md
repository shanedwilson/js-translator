# JS Translator

This project was for an assignment to translate an input text to one of three limited languages contained in objects.

I created a translator function triggered by buttons and also a randomizing component that randomly selects a language when the 'random' button is clicked.

Finally, for extra credit, I used SpeechSynthesisUtterance in JavaScript to vocalize the translated text.
